## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Script in JS


### What I learned

In this challenge I managed to understand how the interactive elements work using hover in the css, I also managed to implement some shadows in the layout of the information box, which makes a good impression at first glance. 
I used media settings to set different settings for different mobile devices
I also demonstrated a little javascript, although simple because it was my first code using js I was very happy with the result

```css
.card {
box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 0px 19px 38px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 0px 15px 12px;
}
```
```js
let ratioWidth = document.getElementById("ratio-width");
let ratioHeight = document.getElementById("ratio-height");
let width = document.getElementById("width");
let height = document.getElementById("height");
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 688px) {
    .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        padding-top: 1100px;
    }
    .attribution{
        opacity: 0;
    }
```
